= devon4quarkus

When implementing apps in Java we support two majore frameworks as flavours in devonfw:

* spring(-boot) with https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki[devon4j]
* https://quarkus.io/[quarkus] with `devon4quarkus` from this repository

== Status

Please note that this repository is currently just evolving and work in progress.
You will also find parts in https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devonfw-microservices/[devonfw-microservices] that will move here over time.
Feel free to get in touch, contriubte and help us to make our quarkus support as great and production-ready as our spring-boot support.
